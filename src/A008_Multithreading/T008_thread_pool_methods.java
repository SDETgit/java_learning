//A Thread Pool is a collection of pre-created worker threads that are ready to execute tasks. 
//Instead of creating a new thread every time you want to perform a task, 
//you reuse existing threads from the pool.
//Imagine a restaurant kitchen:
//You have 5 chefs (threads).
//Customers (tasks) place orders.
//You donâ€™t hire a new chef for every order.
//The same chefs handle new orders as they become free.
//This is what a thread pool does â€” it reuses a fixed number of threads to execute many tasks.
