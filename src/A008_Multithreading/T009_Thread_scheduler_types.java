//In Java, the Thread Scheduler is a part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that determines 
//which thread to run at a given time when multiple threads are in the Runnable state. While 
//Java itself doesn't give direct control over the thread scheduler,
//understanding its types and behavior helps in writing more efficient multi-threaded programs

//ðŸ”¹ What is a Thread Scheduler?
//It decides which thread from the Runnable pool will get CPU time.
//It is OS-dependent (platform-specific).
//It uses various scheduling algorithms, often non-deterministic

//While Java doesnâ€™t let you choose a scheduler, underlying OS-level schedulers typically use these strategies.
//| Scheduler Type                     | Description                                                                          |
//| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
//| **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)** | Threads are scheduled in the order they arrive.                                      |
//| **Time-Slicing (Round Robin)**     | Each thread gets a fixed time slice (quantum) to run, then itâ€™s moved back to queue. |
//| **Priority-Based Scheduling**      | Higher priority threads get preference over lower priority ones.                     |
//| **Preemptive Scheduling**          | A higher priority thread can preempt a lower one at any time.                        |
//| **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**    | Threads are divided into different queues based on type/priority.                    |
