///An immutable class in Java is a class whose objects cannot be modified after creation.
//âœ… Key Characteristics of an Immutable Class
//1. Class is marked as final (to prevent subclassing).
//2. All fields are private and final.
//3. No setter methods.
//4. Defensive copies are made for mutable objects (like arrays or collections).
//5. All initialization is done via constructor.

		 this.age = age;
